## What this repository is

First-party application (type A). Ships as `/usr/bin/eos-notes`, launcher entry `30_eos-notes`.

It is part of **E-OS**, a hardened downstream distribution of [Redox OS](https://www.redox-os.org).
The orchestrating repository — recipes, image configuration and the build system — is
[`e-os/e-os`](https://gitlab.com/e-os/e-os).

## Features

Shipped features are listed in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), each with the commit that introduced
it. Planned work is in the orchestrator's [roadmap](https://gitlab.com/e-os/e-os/-/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/e-os/eos-notes.git && cd eos-notes
cargo check --no-default-features
```

Verified on 2026-08-30:

```
Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s)
```

The graphical half targets `*-unknown-redox` and is built by the orchestrator's cookbook recipe, not
directly on a host.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Toolchain | Rust, pinned by the orchestrator's `rust-toolchain.toml` |
| Host build | CLI/selftest half only — `cargo check --no-default-features` — the GUI targets Redox; Slint's host winit backend no longer compiles on a modern host rustc. |
| Target build | `x86_64-unknown-redox` / `aarch64-unknown-redox`, via the cookbook |
| Dependencies | `eos-ui` (shared Slint-on-Orbital backend), `slint`, `rusqlite`. |

## Security

Report vulnerabilities **privately** — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Never open a public issue
for a security bug.

**This repository has no tests.** That is a known gap, tracked as `S-13` in the orchestrator's
roadmap, and it is stated here rather than left to be discovered.

## License and acknowledgements

[AGPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE). Built on **Redox OS** by Jeremy Soller and the Redox community, and on
the Rust ecosystem. Source of truth is GitLab; the GitHub repository is a read-only mirror.
